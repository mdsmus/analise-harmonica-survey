  abstract	= { This paper defends the view that the intricate
		  difficulties challenging the emerging domain of Musical
		  Pattern Discovery, which is dedicated to the automation of
		  motivic analysis, will be overcome only through a thorough
		  taking into account of the specificity of music as a
		  perceptive object. Actual musical patterns, although
		  constantly transformed, are nevertheless perceived by the
		  listener as musical identities. Such dynamical properties
		  of human perception, not reducible to geometrical models,
		  will only be explained with the notions of contexts and
		  expectations. This paper sketches the general principles of
		  a new approach that attempts to build such a general
		  perceptual system. On a sub-cognitive level, patterns are
		  discovered through the detection, by an associative memory,
		  of local similarities. On a cognitive level, patterns are
		  managed by a general logical framework that avoids
		  irrelevant inferences and combinatorial explosion. In this
		  way, actual musical patterns that convey musical
		  significance are discovered. This approach, offering
		  promising results, is a first step toward a complete system
		  of automated music analysis and an explicit modeling of
		  basic mechanisms for music understanding.},
