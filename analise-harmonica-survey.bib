   ABSTRACT = {
This paper defends the view that the intricate
difficulties challenging the emerging domain of Musical Pattern
Discovery, which is dedicated to the automation of motivic analysis,
will be overcome only through a thorough taking into account of the
specificity of music as a perceptive object. Actual musical patterns,
although constantly transformed, are nevertheless perceived by the
listener as musical identities. Such dynamical properties of human
perception, not reducible to geometrical models, will only be
explained with the notions of contexts and expectations. This paper
sketches the general principles of a new approach that attempts to
build such a general perceptual system. On a sub-cognitive level,
patterns are discovered through the detection, by an associative
memory, of local similarities. On a cognitive level, patterns are
managed by a general logical framework that avoids irrelevant
inferences and combinatorial explosion. In this way, actual musical
patterns that convey musical significance are discovered. This
approach, offering promising results, is a first step toward a
complete system of automated music analysis and an explicit modeling
of basic mechanisms for music understanding.},

   ABSTRACT = {
This paper addresses the genre classification problem
for a specific subset of music, standard and Latin ballroom dance
music, using a classification method based only on timing
information. We compare two methods of extracting periodicities from
audio recordings in order to find the metrical hierarchy and timing
patterns by which the style of the music can be recognised: the first
method performs onset detection and clustering of inter-onset
intervals, the second uses autocorrelation on the amplitude
envelopes of band-limited versions of the signal as its method of
periodicity detection. The relationships between periodicities are
then used to find the metrical hierarchy and to estimate the tempo at
the beat and measure levels of the hierarchy. The periodicities are
then interpreted as musical note values, and the estimated tempo,
meter and the distribution of periodicities are used to predict
the style of music using a simple set of rules. The methods are
evaluated with a test set of standard and Latin dance music, for
which the style and tempo are given on the CD cover, providing a
ground truth by which the automatic classification can be
measured.},

   ABSTRACT = {
The availability of large music collections calls for
ways to efficiently access and explore them. We present a new approach
which combines descriptors derived from audio analysis with
meta-information to create different views of a collection. Such views
can have a focus on timbre, rhythm, artist, style or other aspects of
music. For each view the pieces of music are organized on a map in
such a way that similar pieces are located close to each other. The
maps are visualized using an Islands of Music metaphor where islands
represent groups of similar pieces. The maps are linked to each other
using a new technique to align self-organizing maps. The user is able
to browse the collection and explore different aspects by gradually
changing focus from one view to another. We demonstrate our approach
on a small collection using a meta-information-based view and two
views generated from audio analysis, namely, beat periodicity as an
aspect of rhythm and spectral information as an aspect of timbre.},
