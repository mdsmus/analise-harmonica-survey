  abstract	= { This paper addresses the genre classification problem for
		  a specific subset of music, standard and Latin ballroom
		  dance music, using a classification method based only on
		  timing information. We compare two methods of extracting
		  periodicities from audio recordings in order to find the
		  metrical hierarchy and timing patterns by which the style
		  of the music can be recognised: the first method performs
		  onset detection and clustering of inter-onset intervals,
		  the second uses autocorrelation on the amplitude envelopes
		  of band-limited versions of the signal as its method of
		  periodicity detection. The relationships between
		  periodicities are then used to find the metrical hierarchy
		  and to estimate the tempo at the beat and measure levels of
		  the hierarchy. The periodicities are then interpreted as
		  musical note values, and the estimated tempo, meter and the
		  distribution of periodicities are used to predict the style
		  of music using a simple set of rules. The methods are
		  evaluated with a test set of standard and Latin dance
		  music, for which the style and tempo are given on the CD
		  cover, providing a ground truth by which the automatic
		  classification can be measured.},

  abstract	= { The availability of large music collections calls for
		  ways to efficiently access and explore them. We present a
		  new approach which combines descriptors derived from audio
		  analysis with meta-information to create different views of
		  a collection. Such views can have a focus on timbre,
		  rhythm, artist, style or other aspects of music. For each
		  view the pieces of music are organized on a map in such a
		  way that similar pieces are located close to each other.
		  The maps are visualized using an Islands of Music metaphor
		  where islands represent groups of similar pieces. The maps
		  are linked to each other using a new technique to align
		  self-organizing maps. The user is able to browse the
		  collection and explore different aspects by gradually
		  changing focus from one view to another. We demonstrate our
		  approach on a small collection using a
		  meta-information-based view and two views generated from
		  audio analysis, namely, beat periodicity as an aspect of
		  rhythm and spectral information as an aspect of timbre.},
