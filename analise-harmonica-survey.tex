\section{algoritmos}
% passos
Pattern-matching over chord templates is used in
\cite{prather96:harmonic} and \cite{barthelemy01:figured}, with the
latter using a somewhat more complex model, possibly ignoring
ornamental notes. A rule-based expert system approach is used in
\cite{buzzanca01:rule}, but for music style
regognition. \cite{buzzanca02:supervised} uses a back-propagating
neural network with far better effect. \cite{wang97:generating} uses
three passes for chord identification, all of them assuming a constant
tonality, and consisting basically of pattern-matching on many
levels. \cite{temperley99:modeling} uses a sophisticated
preference-rule based expert system to identify the roots of the
chords in a piece, but it avoids the problems of tonality detection
and harmonic function identification.

For tonality recognition, \cite{barthelemy01:figured} uses an ``island
growing'' approach, a greedy algorithm that is based on the fact that
every chord can be only part of a few tonalities and, detecting each
of those for every chord, tries to merge them when possible, detecting
a tonality change when a merge isn't possible.

\section{Meter and Pitch Representations}
% pedro, passos
In \cite{prather96:harmonic}, pitch height is ignored, as are accidents, and
notes are represented as pitch classes only, ignoring extra
information presente in accidents. Meter, also, is widely simplified,
being reduced to a percentage of time a given pitch class is sounding
in a given measure. In \cite{buzzanca02:supervised}, meter is
represented as the logarithm of beat length, ignoring most complex
beats. \cite{barthelemy01:figured} claims to distinguish enharmonic
notes, even though the exact representation used is not
discussed. MIDI input is used in \cite{wang97:generating}.

\section{segmentation}

% passos, pedro

The segmentation problem, in \cite{prather96:harmonic}, is approached
in a simplified fashion, with chords being assumed to change only in
the beats of a given measure, and tonal information spread between two 
measures being ignored. \cite{bod01:memory} proposes a memory-based
model, contrasting it with rule-based ones, with good results,
although his approach to segmentation in unrelated to harmonic
analysis, and thus not very relevant. \cite{barthelemy01:figured} uses
melodic and harmonic information to construct the segmentation
bottom-up, ie merging two adjacent segments if and only every sound of
the first belongs in the second or if the union (with or without
ornamental notes) of both segments can be exactly mapped onto a
chord. The process starts with minimal segments and ends only when no
more merges can be performed.
