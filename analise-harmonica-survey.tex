\section{algoritmos}
% passos
Pattern-matching over chord templates is used in \cite{prather96:harmonic}. A
rule-based expert system approach is used in \cite{buzzanca01:rule},
but for music style regognition. \cite{buzzanca02:supervised} uses a
back-propagating neural network with far better effect.

\section{representação de altura e ritmo}
% pedro, passos
In \cite{prather96:harmonic}, pitch height is ignored, as are accidents, and
notes are represented as pitch classes only, ignoring extra
information presente in accidents. Meter, also, is widely simplified,
being reduced to a percentage of time a given pitch class is sounding
in a given measure. In \cite{buzzanca02:supervised}, meter is
represented as the logarithm of beat length, ignoring most complex
beats. 

\section{segmentação}
% passos, pedro

The segmentation problem, in a-329-prather.pdf, is approached in a
simplified fasshion, with chords being assumed to change only in the
beats of a given measure, and tonal information spread between two
measures being ignored. bod01:memory.pdf proposes a memory-based
model, contrasting it with rule-based ones, with good results,
although his approach to segmentation in unrelated to harmonic
analysis, and thus not very relevant.
